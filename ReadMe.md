Blipper

Blipper is an emergency assistant Android application. It is designed for the people who need to send SOS during emergency. Add contacts, neighbors, family friends to Blipper and whenever you press the big red "SOS" button, an emergency notification will be sent out to these recipients along with your GPS/Network location and a personalized message will go to each contact. If you or a loved one ever walk through a dark alley, travel abroad or just need to alert someone of your whereabouts this button will simplify explaining exactly where you are.
